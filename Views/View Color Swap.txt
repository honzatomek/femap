This API will do a quick flip from the FEMAP standard background
to a white background with most of the text flipped to black.  
Running it again will swap back.  To use this most effectively, 
connect the API to a custom toolbar button.  For instructions on how
to do this, please see Help - Toolbars - Customization from the main
FEMAP menu.
