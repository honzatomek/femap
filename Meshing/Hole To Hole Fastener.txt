This API is designed for shell/mid-surface FEA models.  It is limited to connecting two 
circular holes, made up of two sets of curves.  

The API asks the user to select two sets of curves.  From the first set, first curve, 
it finds the diameter of the hole.  It then uses this, and the active material, to 
create, or locate and existing beam property.  It then creates two rigid spiders and 
connects them with an element using the property.
