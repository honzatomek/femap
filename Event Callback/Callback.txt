This API program will iterate modifying the plate thickness based on a user defined range and a number of 
iterations. Open the callback.mod model and run the API Startloop to start the process.  This API works in conjunction with callback.bas to modify 
the property, run NX Nastran and wait for a result before resubmitting the job with the next thickness value.
