ExportNodalTempsToExcel

This API is an excellent example of walking output data in FEMAP and sending it over to Microsoft Excel.  
This API is designed for exporting the results of a transient thermal run, where there are multiple output 
sets of temperature data at nodes, the API asks the user to select nodes, and then sends the temperatures 
for these nodes to Excel for every output set.

This API relies on the FEMAP API programming environment knowing about the Excel application object. If you 
have not loaded the reference to the Excel API, you need to right click in the API Programming window, select 
the "References" option, and select the "Microsoft Excel 11.0 Object Library".
