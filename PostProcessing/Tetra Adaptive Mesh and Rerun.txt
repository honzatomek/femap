This API assumes that you have a solid that has been meshed and already run the first time.

It will use the VonMises stresses from the first one, and increase the mesh density of any curve
attached to an element that has a stress gradient from the element centroid to one of its nodes
of more than 10%. 

The mesh sizes on these curves are increased 40%, the mesh is deleted and the model re-run.
