This API determines if conditions exist regarding Rigid elements (RBE2s and RBE3s) which will cause Nastran to fail unless PARAM,AUTOMPC is used.

The three conditions it will report to the messages window are:

Node ID "#" is a RBE2 Dependent node in both elements "A" and "B"

Node ID "#" is a RBE3 Reference node in both elements "A" and "B"

Node ID "#" is the RBE3 Reference Node of element "A" and a RBE2 dependent node of element "B"

One other condition is commented out, but can be used by removing the ' in front of all of the lines.  It will report when:

Node ID "#" is the RBE2 Independent Node of element "A" and a RBE3 node to average of element "B"

This condition does not appear to effect Nastran.
